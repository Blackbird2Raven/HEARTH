| H012        | An adversary is utilizing DNS tunneling to exfiltrate data through DNS port 53. | Exfiltration | Attackers are interested in finding unmonitored communication channels to evade detection. | #DNS #Tunneling #Exfiltration      | [Cody Lunday](https://www.linkedin.com/in/codylunday/)

## Why

- DNS is commonly ignored or lightly monitored by enterprise defense strategies.
- DNS tunneling exploits may give attackers an accessible backchannel to exfiltrate stolen information.
- DNS provides a covert means of correspondence to bypass firewalls.
